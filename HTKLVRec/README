HTKLVRec
--------

This directory is for the HDecode LV recogniser system.

This system is licenced separately from HTK so is not included with
the HTK distribution.  In order to obtain it you must agree to the
licence for HDecode at 

http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/prot-docs/hdecode_register.shtml

where you will also receive instructions for downloading and building
HDecode. If you have HTK 3.5 Beta downloaded and unpacked the instructions 
can be found in the README file.

WINDOWS users: Note that current, Linux, version has not been tested on 
Windows.

Compiling & Installing HTK under UNIX/Linux, OS X or Cygwin
===========================================================

HDecode 3.5 comes with three sets of Makefiles enabling compilation for:

1. CPU (standard)
2. CPU using MKL (Intel Math Kernel library)
3. NVIDIA GPUs (Graphic Processing Unit) using the NVIDIA CUDA compiler NVCC

These alternative Makefiles are located in HLVRec directory.

Examine the MakefileCPU, MakefileMKL and  MakefileNVCC files and change 
the default locations of CPU/GPU compilers and libraries to match the
locations on the system for which HDecode 3.5 is to be installed.

In order to compile either the standard CPU version, or 
the CPU version with MKL support or GPU version execute one of the following 

1. make -f MakefileCPU all
2. make -f MakefileMKL all 
3. make -f MakefileNVCC all

commands.

Having compiled one of the branches (CPU/MKL/NVCC), the 
relevant HDecode tools can be installed executing one of the following

1. make -f MakefileCPU install
2. make -f MakefileMKL install
3. make -f MakefileNVCC install

commands. By default HDecode tools will be installed in bin.cpu, bin.mkl 
or bin.gpu depending on the branch. 

Prior to compiling a new branch it is important to clean the distribution

1. make -f MakefileCPU clean
2. make -f MakefileMKL clean
3. make -f MakefileNVCC clean
